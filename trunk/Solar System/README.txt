Solar System
by
Jason Hsu (jh84) and Jian Wei Gan (jg76)

Started: 17 Sept 09 (Thursday)
Finished: 22 Sept 09 (Tuesday)
Hours spent on it:
    Wei: 4 hours
    Jason: 7 hours
    
Discussed how camera should move with Eric.
Thanks to Professor Duvall for help at office hours, as well as fun with TinkerToys.

Program Input
*************
Note: input is NOT case sensitive.

Things that came with the project:
ESC or Q:   quits the program
Z       :   Show Frames per second
P       :   Pause if playing, play if paused

Camera Controls:
We decided to make this move around like a first person (space) shooter (Descent anyone?)
because it lets us move anywhere in the world as opposed to our camera rotating around a
single object. We realize this might be less intuitive for our particular 3D scene, but we
really enjoy moving around within our solar system as though we're in a space ship.  Fun!
Now we just need to add some lasers and exploding planets.


Up/Down/Left/Right:     Rotates camera about current position in direction pressed
I:                      Zoom In
O:                      Zoom Out

With these controls, you can move anywhere in our solar system.

Simulation Controls:
H:  hides orbits
J:  shows orbits
R:  restart simulation
C:  reset camera

Input File:
We apologize for the inscrutable input file format.

---------------

To run our program, just run our Main.java class.
We've tested this on Intel Macs.
